## About Me
***
I am 33 years old. I work as a teacher of information technology and special disciplines  at a college. I like to develop and improve. But after 10 years of working in college, I realized that the scope of the educational process does not allow me to develop. That's why I'm here. My goal is to become a sought-after specialist in the field of frontend development.
